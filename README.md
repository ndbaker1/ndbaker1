### 🍥🍜🦐

I'm Nick,

In High School I started off creating things in `Java ☕` & `Python 🐍` such as:
* [Neural Network Implementations](https://github.com/ndbaker1/NeuralNets)
* [WAV visualizer using Fourier Transforms](https://github.com/ndbaker1/WAV-analyzer)

Then in University I began attending hackathons, which helped me develop presentation skills and learn the `NodeJS` stack along with frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Svelte

As I started working Part-time, I acquired many real world skills like `Cloud Computing ☁️`, `CI/CD 📦`, and `Docker 🐳`

I worked with `Kotlin` SpringBoot for REST apis and JPA hibernate interactions

> *I also had become sick of conventional `Java ☕` at this point, but `Kotlin` revived the JVM experience for me with
better syntactic sugar and more concise control flow.*

After completing the **Operating Systems** and **Compiler Design** courses at University, I funneled my curiousity about programming languages and virtualization into [`Koala`](https://github.com/ndbaker1/koala), a '*toy*' programming language which compiles down to instructions for its own virtual machine.

My appreciation of programming languages increased dramatically as well, and I found myself wanting to use languages like `Rust 🦀` which provides a powerful type system and  optimized binaries courtesy of the LLVM backend.
